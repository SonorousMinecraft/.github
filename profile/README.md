**An Adventure RPG fantasy Minecraft Server with most of the commonly seen features**

**The aim is to use Minecraft as a game engine and completely transform the game with no client side downloads**

*Note: All of this is made by [Sujan Naik](https://github.com/Sujan-Naik), please do not use it on your own Server, it is public as a learning material for developers and to showcase on my portfolio*

## An overview of my Modules
- [Abilities](https://github.com/SonorousMinecraft/SonorousAbilities) (alpha)
> A groundbreakingly complex ability system, heavily inspired by [Project Korra](https://projectkorra.com/) but written from scratch and aims to do things a different way
> Consists of Archetypes (the name for classes) such as Earth, Ocean, Sky, Sun, Chaos etc
> Makes use of block displays and item displays released in Minecraft 1.19.4 to create visually appealing abilities

- [RPG](https://github.com/SonorousMinecraft/SonorousRPG) (skill system at vertical slice, other features not implemented yet)
> The centerpiece of the server, skill system, custom enchantments, custom items, etc
> The skill system features passives and levels for each player.

- [World Generation](https://github.com/SonorousMinecraft/SonorousWorldGen) (pre-alpha, works but I have ideas to improve it)
> An entirely revamped world generation from scratch designed to rejuvenate the world 
> Uses noise to generate more coherent continent based land masses with intuitive biome placement
> Custom tree generation (large ones) using fractal noise
> Structure generation using WorldEdit Schematics
> Procedurally generated Kingdoms that can place entities, using WorldEdit schematic buildings

- [Mobs](https://github.com/SonorousMinecraft/SonorousMobs) (pre-alpha but probably making major changes)
> A complete re-doing of Minecraft's entity AI. Probably not good as it stands
> Makes use of an adapted Procedural version of SonorousAbilities
> More complex behaviours and whatnot
> Pathfinding with Navmeshes 

- [Models](https://github.com/SonorousMinecraft/SonorousModels) (still early stages)
> A new idea I had to figure out how to make modded Models in Minecraft as a plugin
> This will at some stage be used with Mobs

- [NPCs](https://github.com/SonorousMinecraft/SonorousNPCs) (needs to be redone largely)
> A naive attempt at complex behaving NPCs
> Features a dialogue system that also allows for movement
